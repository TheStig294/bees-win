# Bees Win
## This mod only works with [Custom Roles for TTT](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2421039084)

This mod re-adds the "bees win", which happens whenever everyone dies at the same time in a round of TTT! (Instead of a traitor win)\
\
This mod is compatible with **some versions** of the jihad bomb, and the death link, where the bees win won't trigger if the last players alive were killed by these weapons.\
\
The "Bees Win" idea comes from the linked episode of Yogscast TTT, which was made official in the [Town of Terror](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092556189) mod by [Jensons](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044525091).\
Credit goes to the Yogscast for the video thumbnail used in the workshop icon.

## Convars
Use the following to turn back on certain weapons triggering a bees win:\
*ttt_bees_win_suicide_bomb 1*\
*ttt_bees_win_death_link 1*
